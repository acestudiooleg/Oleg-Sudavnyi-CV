# Oleg Sudavnyi - Senior Software Engineer


## Summary of Qualifications

I have about 7 years of experience in IT. I started as a PHP Developer and then switched to JavaScript.  Therefore, four last years I worked as Frontend Developer or Javascript Fullstack Developer. I have been involved in several software projects related to different spheres of business such as banking, logistic, nature, lottery and entertainment (events, virtual tours and concerts). In this CV, I described my five significant projects I was involved. At my projects, I had a chance to work on application design from scratch, working on requirements analysis and specifications, issues detection, analysis and resolving, coding, testing, code improvement and maintenance with producing technical documentation. 

Projects I was involved in, gave me an experience and deep understanding of web-development, particularly in JavaScript related stack, including work with HTML5/CSS3 and REST methodology altogether with HTTP protocol. As a plus I have good knowledge in the design of frontend single page applications based on Ember, Express, RequireJS and AngularJS frameworks. In addition, I have an experience working with NodeJS.  As a plus, I have good experience working with Bootstrap framework and used LESS and PostCSS preprocessors. In addition, I had a chance to develop the hybrid mobile applications based on Cordova with React/Redux framework. I have used build systems like Grunt, Gulp and WebPack. I worked with Maps, Social webs and authentication services like Auth0. I think every software application needs automation tests since it saves a lot of time to find issues and helps to create a high-quality product expectedly we use TDD or BDD practices. I have good experience and understanding of automation testing based on work with Karma, Mocha, Jasmine and Protractor. 

Have strong experience in OOD, OOP and design patterns.  Beside of this I have experience working with backend languages such as PHP and SQL. I had a chance to work with RDBMS and NoSQL based on MySQL and MongoDB. I have good experience of working with applications using the AWS. 

I have good understanding Service Oriented concepts and experience with Agile, Scrum and Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The web technologies are my passion and profession. I am a target-oriented software developer with a technical engineering background. I always try to do efficient work in a team. I have quick learning ability and I always open to new challenges with interest and enthusiasm.
